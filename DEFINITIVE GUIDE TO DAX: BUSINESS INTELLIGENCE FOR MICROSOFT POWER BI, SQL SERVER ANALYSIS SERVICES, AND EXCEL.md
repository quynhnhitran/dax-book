# 1.Contents
-  CHAPTER 1 What is DAX?
    - brief introduction to DAX
    - hints: the differences between DAX and other languages
-  CHAPTER 2 Introducing DAX
    - cover basic concepts: calculated columns, measures, and error-handling functions
-  CHAPTER 3 Using basic table functions
    - basis table functions: many functions in DAX work on tables and return tables as a result 
    - advanced table funtions in Chapter 12 & 13
-  CHAPTER 4 Understanding evaluation contexts
    - evaluation contexts => foundation of the DAX language => *most important in the entire book*
-  CHAPTER 5 Understanding CALCULATE and CALCULATETABLE
    - two functions: CALCULATE & CALCULATETABLE => *most important functions in DAX*
